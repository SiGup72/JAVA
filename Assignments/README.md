# Java Programming Practice Repository  

This repository contains a collection of Java practice programs, organized into five modules. Each module is designed to help understand and implement key concepts of Java programming.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  

### 1. Basics  
- Focuses on simple programs using operators, variables, and user input/output.  
- Builds the foundation for syntax and core operations.  

### 2. Control Structures  
- Covers decision-making (`if-else`, `switch`) and looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  
- Helps in writing programs with conditional logic and repeated execution.  

### 3. Arrays  
- Introduces one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.  
- Covers basic operations like traversal, insertion, searching, and simple problem-solving using arrays.  

### 4. Classes and Objects  
- Demonstrates the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
- Covers object creation, methods, constructors, and encapsulation.  

### 5. Inheritance  
- Explains code reusability through parent-child class relationships.  
- Includes examples of single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

### 6. Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Introduces abstraction in Java using abstract classes and the interface keyword.
- Shows how abstract methods enforce structure and how interfaces support multiple inheritance.

### 7. Packages
- Demonstrates how to organize code using packages and subpackages.
- Includes examples of compiling packages using javac -d . and importing them in external programs.

### 8. Exception Handling
- Covers handling runtime errors using try, catch, and finally.
- Includes custom exceptions, multi-level exception hierarchy, and command-line argument validation.

### 9. File Handling
- Explores reading and writing files using Java I/O classes.
- Includes checking file properties, modifying permissions, buffered reading/writing, and structured data storage.
  

## 🎯 Objective  

- To provide a complete, structured learning path for Java beginners and intermediate learners.
- To strengthen understanding of Java fundamentals through hands-on coding exercises across nine core modules.
- To apply OOP concepts step by step, starting from basics to advanced principles, including abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces.
- To develop practical skills in advanced concepts like packages, exception handling, and file operations.
- To serve as a quick reference for beginners revising Java.
