# Java Programming Practice Repository  

This repository contains a collection of Java practice programs, organized into five modules. Each module is designed to help understand and implement key concepts of Java programming.  

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure  

### 1. Basics  
- Focuses on simple programs using operators, variables, and user input/output.  
- Builds the foundation for syntax and core operations.  

### 2. Control Structures  
- Covers decision-making (`if-else`, `switch`) and looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  
- Helps in writing programs with conditional logic and repeated execution.  

### 3. Arrays  
- Introduces one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.  
- Covers basic operations like traversal, insertion, searching, and simple problem-solving using arrays.  

### 4. Classes and Objects  
- Demonstrates the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
- Covers object creation, methods, constructors, and encapsulation.  

### 5. Inheritance  
- Explains code reusability through parent-child class relationships.  
- Includes examples of single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  

- To strengthen understanding of Java fundamentals through hands-on coding.  
- To apply OOP concepts step by step, starting from basics to advanced principles.  
- To serve as a quick reference for beginners revising Java.
