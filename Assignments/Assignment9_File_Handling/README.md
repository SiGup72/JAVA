# Java File Handling Assignment

This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate fundamental file handling operations, including checking file properties, modifying permissions, reading and writing data, and using buffered streams.

The assignment demonstrates:

- Checking whether a given path refers to a file or directory
- Changing file permissions programmatically
- Performing basic file read/write operations
- Using BufferedWriter and BufferedReader for efficient I/O
- Writing and reading structured data from a text file

## Programs
- **CheckFileorDirectory** - Checks whether a given path exists and identifies whether it is a file or a directory.
- **ChangeFilePermissions** - Modifies the permissions of a file, such as enabling or disabling read, write, or execute access.
- **ReadWrite** - Performs simple file read and file write operations using standard Java I/O classes.
- **BufferedFile** - Writes structured data — Serial No. (int), First Name (String), CGPA (float), and Grade (char) — into a text file using BufferedWriter, and then reads and displays the contents using BufferedReader.
